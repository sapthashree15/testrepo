<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Alpha testing </b></td> 
<td width="70%">is the first functioning version of the system released to a select group of stakeholders. The alpha release likely contains errors and may not contain the full feature set but does contain most of the desired functionality.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Architecture</b></td> 
<td width="70%">The architecture of a software system is the structural and behavioral framework on which all other aspects of the system depend. It is the organizational structure of a software system including components, connections, constraints, and rationale.

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Beta testing </b></td>

<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Integration Testing </b></td> 
<td width="70%"> is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Linters</b></td> 
<td width="70%">is an automated tool, known to detect programmatic and stylistic errors, and comment on the code itself to make it easy for others to understand and modify.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Maintenance</b></td> 
<td width="70%"> helps to find any other bugs, identify user interface issues, or UI for short, and identify other requirements that may not have been listed in the SRS.
</td> 
</tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Non-functional </b></td> 
<td width="70%"> is the term used to describe system characteristics including performance, safety, security, and quality requirements.  
</td> </tr>

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Objectives</b></td> 
<td width="70%"> are actionable, measurable actions that achieve the goal.</td> </tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Planning </b></td>

</td> </tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Software Engineering </b></td>

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Software Developers </b></td> 
<td width="70%">Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools.</td> </tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) </b></td> 
<td width="70%"> is a systematic process to develop high-quality software in a predictable timeframe and budget. </td> </tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  </b></td> 
<td width="70%">is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.</td> </tr> 

<tr> 
<td width="30%"valign="top"><b>Software Stack </b></td> 
<td width="70%">A software stack is a collection of independent components that work together to support the execution of an application. </td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>Software Version </b></td> 
<td width="70%">is a number that indicates when the software was released, when it was updated, and if any minor changes or patches were made to the software.  
</td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>Software Documentation </b></td> 
<td width="70%"> is information about the software that describes what 
the product is and how to use it. These can be written, video, or graphical assets associated with a software product’s development and use.

</td> </tr> 
<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>System Requirement Specification (SysRS) </b></td> 
<td width="70%">documents system capabilities and acceptance criteria, and policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and hardware requirements.  
</td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>System Testing </b></td> 
<td width="70%"> is testing conducted on a complete integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.  
</td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>Testing</b></td> 
<td width="70%"> is the process of verifying that the software matches established requirements and is free of bugs.
</td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>Unit Testing </b></td> 
<td width="70%">is the process of testing the smallest component of code that can be isolated from the rest of the system.
</td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) </b></td> 
<td width="70%">is carried out by future users in a (simulated) operational environment focusing on user requirements and needs.

<td width="70%"> The V-shape model is named as such because the phases form the shape of a V. The phases going down the left side of the V are called “verification". Then, going up the right side of the V, those phases are called, "validation." The V-shape model is like a waterfall in that it is also sequential. 
</td> </tr> 

<tr> <td width="30%" valign="top"><b>Waterfall Model </b></td> 
<td width="70%">Waterfall is a sequential method of software development where the output of one phase is the input for the next phase of the cycle.
